Homework 05 â€“ Trivia Game notes

I did the harder version of this homework

And it turned out much harder than I expected.  

I am frustrated that as of writing this it is not a 100% done.

I have all the content elements required completed.  I had the parts
of the page being hidden and revealed (hide and show) but I had to 
comment them out to debug the program.

What is left is for me to figure out what is happening with my COUNTERS
and why they are incrementing in code parts I did not expect.  And, I
believe once that is done, I would need to "uncomment" lines of code to
again hide and show as the game progresses.
