Homework 05 â€“ Trivia Game notes

I did the harder version of this homework

And it turned out much harder than I expected.  

I am frustrated that as of writing this it is not a 100% done.

I have all the content elements required completed.  

I do not have two parts of the code completed: 1) I do not know
why the hide and show code is not working.  This would allow
for each of the divs to be hidden or revealed as the user
plays the game. 2) There is one button that disappears, the 
Play New Game button, that is there until it is time to be used
in the right way.

I have spent a TON of time rewriting this HARDER version of 
the homework.  I did learn about "binding" which was causing one
of my bugs ... I still have conceptual gaps in my knowledge about
that and how it works.  And more importantly, how to set up code 
structure ahead of time so that I do not run into this issue again.

I look forward to a discussion on that last part.

And I hope there is credit given for the HARDER homework being
attempted and almost getting there.
